description: "The Power of Movement in Plants is a book by Charles Darwin on phototropism\
  \ and other types of movement in plants. This book continues his work in producing\
  \ evidence for his theory of natural selection. As it was one of his last books,\
  \ followed only by the publication of The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the\
  \ Action of Worms, he was assisted by his son Francis in conducting the necessary\
  \ experiments and preparing the manuscript. The Power of Movement in Plants was\
  \ published 6 November 1880, and 1500 copies were quickly sold by publisher John\
  \ Murray.\nThis book stands at the culmination of a long line of study in plants\
  \ and is immediately preceded by 'The different forms of flowers on Plants of the\
  \ same species’ (1877). (See Bibliography for additional publications on plants.)\
  \ These studies on plants were first evidenced in 'On the various contrivances by\
  \ which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects’ (1862), the publication\
  \ that immediately followed On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection.\n\
  He co-authored this study with his son Francis Darwin (who specialised in botany)\
  \ and his devotee, George Romanes, who assisted in editing the work. The work was\
  \ begun in earnest late in 1877, after his work on climbing plants (1875) and insectivorous\
  \ plants (1875) stimulated his interest in the subject. At times, Darwin despaired\
  \ of ever finishing the work, as the book outgrew his original expectations:\n\"\
  I have written a rather big book—more is the pity—on the movements of plants, and\
  \ I am now just beginning to go over the MS. for the second time, which is a horrid\
  \ bore.\"\nAs the book neared completion, he summarised its underlying viewpoint:\n\
  \"My MS. relates to the movements of plants, and I think that I have succeeded in\
  \ showing that all the more important great classes of movements are due to the\
  \ modification of a kind of movement common to all parts of all plants from their\
  \ earliest youth.\"\nThe work concerns itself with how plants respond to external\
  \ stimuli and examines these processes in individual plants to gain understanding\
  \ of some general principles governing their growth and life. This continues Darwin’s\
  \ work of elucidating how natural selection works and specifically how plants have\
  \ adapted to differing environments whilst at the same time answering some objections\
  \ of his day that evolution could not account for changes in behavioural responses.\
  \ In his conclusions, Darwin presents the key features of plants from an evolutionary\
  \ perspective indicating that gradual modification of these processes in response\
  \ to natural selective forces like light and water could enable extensive ability\
  \ to adapt.\nThe process that creates the circular or elliptical movement of the\
  \ stem and tips of plants (circumnutation) was identified as a significant one in\
  \ enabling plants to evolve and adapt to almost any environment on the planet. Darwin\
  \ also drew attention to the similarities between animals and plants, e.g., sensitivity\
  \ to touch (thigmotropism), light sensitivity (phototropism), and gravity (geotropism).\
  \ Darwin used various methods of enquiry: usually setting up rigorous controlled\
  \ experiments which are clearly explained in the text, reporting the results and\
  \ then drawing general conclusions. Studies of nyctinasty were particularly burdensome,\
  \ to Darwin's rest as well as to the plants:\n\"I think we have proved that the\
  \ sleep of plants is to lessen the injury to the leaves from radiation. This has\
  \ interested me much, and has cost us great labour, as it has been a problem since\
  \ the time of Linnaeus. But we have killed or badly injured a multitude of plants.\"\
